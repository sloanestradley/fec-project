# FECLedger — Sankey diagram data model + library research

> **BUILD UNDERWAY — Steps 0–3 shipped; Steps 4–5 pending (updated 2026-06-09).** Originally research-only (2026-06-04); the build began the same week. **Shipped:** Step 0 (donut field-name fixes), Step 1 (shared `sankey.js` + vendored Apache ECharts 5.5.1), Step 2 (mount on candidate.html), Step 3 (mount on committee.html + form-agnostic adapter) — the Money-flow Sankey now renders on both profile pages, **coexisting with the donuts**. **Pending:** Step 4 (the donut↔Sankey scope toggle — blocked on product decisions in Claude Chat: donut-scope rule + layout/IA) and Step 5 (fast-follows: presidential ungate per §4a Gate 2, a11y data table, full `.viz-tt` tooltip alignment, color rank-vs-identity, dual-account modeling, conduit precompute). This doc remains the durable reference for the FEC data model (§1–§2), the conservation contract (§4), and the v1 gates + ungate paths (§4a); the rendered prototype is `strategy/sankey-examples.html`.

*Self-contained; no prior context needed. Prepared from a research-mode session on 2026-06-04.*

## Goal

Replace the Raised donut + Spent donut (and, eventually, the Spending-by-Purpose bars) on `candidate.html` and `committee.html` with a single **Sankey diagram** of money flow: receipt sources → the committee → disbursement categories. The motivating insight is that two disconnected donuts hide the relationship between where money comes from and where it goes; a Sankey makes that one continuous picture.

Phasing decision (Sloane, 2026-06-04): **ship a totals-based Sankey first, WITHOUT spending purpose.** Even the totals-only version is a large win over the current donuts. Spending-purpose detail is a separate, harder research track (see §6).

---

## 1. The core finding: receipts and disbursements ARE clean partitions — at the right level

Both sides of the FEC `/totals/` endpoint form a **mutually-exclusive AND collectively-exhaustive partition** — the leaf categories sum *exactly* to the cycle `receipts` / `disbursements` total. This is what makes a conserving Sankey possible at all.

**Verified to the penny against live API (cycle 2024). All four reconcile exactly on both sides** — re-run with the corrected leaf set on 2026-06-08 (see note below the table):

| Committee | `receipts` | leaf-sum check | `disbursements` | leaf-sum check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Candidate PCC — Marie for Congress (C00806174) | $11,856,001.72 | exact ✓ | $11,895,854.48 | exact ✓ |
| Super PAC — Senate Majority PAC (C00484642) | $389,968,278.37 | exact ✓ | $391,182,162.25 | exact ✓ |
| Party — DCCC (C00000935) | $339,935,852.88 | exact ✓ | $331,933,274.36 | exact ✓ |
| Conduit — ActBlue (C00401224) | $3,821,173,165.20 | exact ✓ | $3,789,960,310.57 | exact ✓ |

> **Supersession note (2026-06-08):** the original 2026-06-04 research pass marked DCCC and ActBlue *disbursements* as "within rounding (~$3)." That was a leaf-set error in the hand-computation — `fed_candidate_contribution_refunds` was being summed on the disbursement side when it belongs on the receipt side. The corrected entity-aware adapter (the §2 leaf set as finalized) re-run on 2026-06-08 reconciles **all four entities to $0.00 residual on both sides**. The "within rounding" figures are superseded; there is no rounding drift in the verified leaf set.

**The catch:** the same endpoint mixes leaf fields with three classes of trap field. Summing naively double-counts (this caused +$50M / +$192M disbursement overages on the first pass before the traps were identified). The leaf set also **differs by form type** (candidate Form 3/3P vs PAC-party Form 3X).

### Trap fields — DO NOT sum these alongside the leaves

1. **Subtotals / rollups:** `contributions` (= individual + PAC + party), `individual_contributions` (= itemized + unitemized). These are sums of their own children.
2. **Net figures:** `net_contributions` (= contributions − refunds), `net_operating_expenditures` (= operating_exp − offsets). Gross-minus-contra, not categories.
3. **Duplicate aliases — same money under another name, *but only for fed-only committees*** (correction 2026-06-08 — see warning below): `fed_receipts` ≡ `receipts`; `fed_disbursements` ≡ `disbursements`; `fed_operating_expenditures` ≡ `other_fed_operating_expenditures` ≡ `operating_expenditures`.

> **⚠ The `fed_*` ≡ total aliases are CONDITIONAL, not universal (corrected 2026-06-08).** They hold only for committees that run **no non-federal (soft-money) account**. For a committee that *does* (most state/territory party federal accounts; some non-fed-account PACs), the **total** `receipts`/`disbursements` fold in non-federal money that the `fed_*` figures exclude — and that total is what the Sankey conserves against and what the cash identity (§4) closes on. The divergence is material, not rounding.
>
> **Verified counterexample — Democratic Party of Wisconsin Federal (C00019331), 2024:**
> - `receipts` $63,427,392.68 vs `fed_receipts` $51,325,830.95 → diff **$12,101,561.73** = `transfers_from_nonfed_account` ($12,088,940.37) + `transfers_from_nonfed_levin` ($12,621.36).
> - `disbursements` $61,697,041.92 vs `fed_disbursements` $46,403,630.95 → diff **$15,293,410.97** = `shared_nonfed_operating_expenditures` ($15,262,501.74) + `shared_fed_activity_nonfed` ($30,909.23).
> - Cash identity closes on **totals only**: $404,371.94 start + receipts − disbursements = $2,134,722.70 end (exact). Fed-only figures do **not** close.
> - The **`operating_expenditures` alias trio also breaks** here: `operating_expenditures` ≡ `fed_operating_expenditures` ($29,411,929.43) still held, but `other_fed_operating_expenditures` ($5,562,968.68) **diverged** — so no `fed_*`/`other_fed_*` field is a safe alias for a dual-account committee.
>
> **Control — DCCC (C00000935), 2024:** same *Party–Qualified* committee type, yet `receipts` ≡ `fed_receipts`, `disbursements` ≡ `fed_disbursements`, every non-federal field $0 (national party, no soft money post-BCRA). **So the signal is NOT committee type — it's data-driven:** `receipts !== fed_receipts || disbursements !== fed_disbursements` flags a dual-account committee. (ActBlue and Senate Majority PAC are also fed-only controls — note a *hybrid PAC's "non-contribution account" is still federal* and is correctly NOT flagged; "non-federal" = state/local soft money, a different thing.) These committees are **gated out of the v1 Sankey** — see the v1 scope-gates section below.

## 2. Category definitions

**Provenance note:** the OpenFEC swagger (`https://api.open.fec.gov/swagger/?format=openapi`) documents only metadata fields (`committee_type`, `committee_designation`, `filing_frequency`, etc.) — **none of the receipt/disbursement money fields carry a description in the API schema.** Definitions below are sourced from the **FEC report forms themselves** (Form 3 House/Senate, Form 3P presidential, Form 3X PAC/party) and their line-item instructions, then cross-checked against the verified arithmetic above. They are NOT from the API spec — that spec is silent here.

### Receipts — candidate committees (Form 3 / 3P)

| API field | Definition | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `transfers_from_affiliated_party` | Transfers in from affiliated / other party committees | 12 |
| `all_loans_received` | All loans received (this was the $25M line that balanced SMP) | 13 |
| `other_fed_receipts` | Other federal receipts — dividends, interest (3X equivalent of `other_receipts`) | 17 |
| `transfers_from_nonfederal_account` | Non-federal / Levin transfers (party cmtes with allocated activity — verify if a party cmte is in scope) | 18 |

### Disbursements — candidate committees (Form 3)

| API field | Definition | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `operating_expenditures` | ALL operating spend — vendors, staff, media, fundraising, travel — as ONE undifferentiated bucket | 17 |
| `transfers_to_other_authorized_committee` | Transfers out to the candidate's other authorized committees | 18 |
| `loan_repayments` | Repayments of loans (candidate + other) | 19 |
| `contribution_refunds` | Money returned to donors. Splits into `refunded_individual_contributions` / `refunded_political_party_committee_contributions` / `refunded_other_political_committee_contributions` | 20 |
| `other_disbursements` | Miscellaneous | 21 |
| `fundraising_disbursements`, `exempt_legal_accounting_disbursement` | Presidential-specific exempt categories | 3P |

### Disbursements — PAC / party committees (Form 3X)

`operating_expenditures` + `contribution_refunds` + `other_disbursements` as above, plus:

| API field | Definition | Line |
|---|---|---|
| `fed_candidate_committee_contributions` | Money the committee GAVE to federal candidates / their committees (core leadership-PAC activity) | 23 |
| `independent_expenditures` | Spending for/against candidates with no coordination (super PACs, parties) — separate additive leaf, NOT nested in operating_expenditures (verified) | 24 |
| `coordinated_expenditures_by_party_committee` | 441a(d) coordinated party expenditures — party committees only | 25 |
| `transfers_to_affiliated_committee` | Transfers out to affiliated / other party committees | 22 |
| `loan_repayments_made` | Repayments of loans the committee received | 26 |

## 3. The hierarchy → responsive depth mapping

The receipt side is a natural 3-level tree, which means **mobile-vs-desktop is not a custom simplification — it's just which depth you render.** The Level-1/Level-2 nodes ARE the subtotal fields (`contributions`, `individual_contributions`), so the collapse is free.

```
receipts
├── contributions                                 ← L1 node "Contributions"
│   ├── individual_contributions                  ← L2 node "Individuals"
│   │   ├── individual_itemized_contributions     ← L3 leaf
│   │   └── individual_unitemized_contributions   ← L3 leaf
│   ├── other_political_committee_contributions   ← L3 leaf "PACs"
│   └── political_party_committee_contributions   ← L3 leaf "Party"
├── transfers_from_*                              ← L1 leaf "Transfers"
├── loans (candidate) / all_loans_received (3X)   ← L1 leaf "Loans"
├── candidate_contribution                        ← L1 leaf "Self-funding"
├── offsets_to_*                                  ← L1 leaf "Offsets"
└── other_receipts / other_fed_receipts           ← L1 leaf "Other"
```

- **Mobile (Level 1):** Contributions · Transfers · Loans · Self-funding · Offsets · Other → **Committee** → Operating · To candidates · IEs · Refunds · Transfers · Other
- **Desktop (Level 3):** explode Contributions → Itemized / Unitemized / PAC / Party; etc.

Disbursements have no comparable depth at the totals level (`operating_expenditures` is one flat bucket) — depth on the spend side only arrives with the purpose layer (§6).

**Existing donut grouping to inherit or override (candidate.html, `renderContributorDonut`, 2026-06-08):** the current raised donut does NOT render the three loan/self fields as three separate wedges. It groups them by **source** (who the money came from), not by instrument:
- **"Candidate self-funding"** wedge = `candidate_contribution` (a gift) **+** `loans_made_by_candidate` (a loan). The candidate's own loan is grouped with their own gift — both are money from the candidate.
- **"Loans"** wedge = `all_other_loans` only (banks / third parties). Tooltip explicitly says "not including candidate self-funding loans."
- (Similarly, the donut merges the three `offsets_to_*` fields into one **"Refunds & offsets"** wedge.)

So the §2 leaf tables list `candidate_contribution` / `loans_made_by_candidate` / `all_other_loans` as three atomic leaves, but the live donut pre-groups them 2+1 by source. **Sankey decision:** keep the donut's source-based grouping (self-funding vs external loans — cleaner story, and lets the candidate's loan sit beside their gift) OR expand to the raw three leaves (more granular, but "Loans" then needs to disambiguate candidate vs bank). Decide deliberately rather than inheriting by accident. This grouping is **candidate.html only** — committee (Form 3X) committees have no `candidate_contribution` / `loans_made_by_candidate` fields, so there's no "Candidate self-funding" wedge there (the candidate↔committee category asymmetry noted in §2 applies here too).

---

## 4. Conservation / reconciliation — left total ≠ right total (by design)

Receipts and disbursements **do not balance**, and that's correct: the difference is absorbed by cash-on-hand and debt.

```
cash_on_hand_beginning_period + receipts − disbursements = last_cash_on_hand_end_period
```

**Open decision (→ Chat, see §8):** whether to make the Sankey *visibly* conserve by adding `Cash on hand (start)` as a left node and `Cash on hand (end)` + `Debt` as right nodes (left-total = right-total, more honest, but +2–3 nodes and needs a clear visual story for "money that didn't move"), or keep it as sources→committee→spend and accept the two ends don't sum. *(Resolved by the `sankey-examples.html` prototype: COH start/end ARE nodes, debt is a caption annotation — the prototype wins where it overlaps.)*

## 4a. v1 scope gates — what the Sankey does NOT model in v1

Two classes of entity are **gated out of the v1 Sankey**: the v1 totals-based model can't conserve for them without additional, separately-verified work. A gated entity must **never** render a Sankey that silently under-sums — it shows a neutral **"not yet modeled"** state in the coexist phase, and after the Step-4 scope toggle falls back to the **donut** (the Step-4 reversal retained the donuts as the gated / out-of-scope fallback; the original "remove donuts in v1" plan was dropped once Step 0 made them correct). **Critical for Gate 1:** that donut fallback was found *actively wrong* for dual-account committees (double-counts shared non-fed operating, buries FEA, omits non-fed receipts, rebases percentages) and is being corrected now — see the Gate 1 decided plan below. The donuts' earlier A2 field-name bugs were fixed standalone — Step 0, 2026-06-08; a third same-class fix, the committee spent-donut `loan_repayments_made + loan_repayments` coalesce, landed in the 2026-06-09 post-build sweep — a miscategorization, not an under-sum, since that donut's "Other" is a conserving remainder.

**Gate 1 — committees with a non-federal (soft-money) account.** For these, the **total** `receipts`/`disbursements` fold in non-federal money the v1 leaf set doesn't model, so the fed-side leaves under-sum the total by the non-federal amount (Wisconsin: a $12.1M / $15.3M residual — the exact "silent under-sum" we must avoid). Modeling them correctly means pulling in the full party-committee partition — a "Transfers from non-federal account" receipt leaf, "Non-federal operating (shared)" + "Non-federal election activity (Levin)" disbursement leaves, plus FEA / Levin / coordinated-party-expenditure interactions — which is its own verified workstream. **Decided plan (2026-06-09) below.**
- **Detector (data-driven, NOT committee type):** `entity === 'committee' && (Math.abs(receipts − fed_receipts) > 1 || Math.abs(disbursements − fed_disbursements) > 1)`. The entity gate / null-guard is load-bearing: candidate (Form 3) totals carry **no `fed_receipts` field**, so an un-guarded `receipts !== fed_receipts` would read `X !== undefined` and flag *every candidate*. The `> 1` tolerance (not strict `!==`) guards against sub-dollar FEC rounding; controls return exactly `0.00` today, so the tolerance is defensive.
- **Rationale / fixtures:** dual-account = **C00019331** (Dem Party of Wisconsin Fed, 2024 — see the §1 reconciliation); fed-only control = **C00000935** (DCCC, same *Party–Qualified* type, fully fed). It is not committee type — DCCC and Wisconsin share a type and differ only in the data.
- **Prevalence:** mostly state/territory party federal accounts + some non-fed-account PACs — common committee search results, so the gated state will be seen with real frequency (it is not a rare edge).
- **Orthogonal to cohStart-derivation (A1):** Wisconsin's cash identity closes *exactly* on totals — its issue is leaf coverage, not COH. Conversely ActBlue (fed-only, *not* gated) still fails the cash identity by ~$889, which only deriving cohStart fixes. Two independent mechanisms; don't conflate them.

> **Gate 1 — decisions + verified ungate recipe (2026-06-09).** Investigated against 5 real dual-account committees (real-key `/totals/`). **Three decisions locked:**
> - **Sequencing — fix the donut NOW, un-gate LATER.** The donut is the retained fallback for gated entities (Step-4 reversal, see §4a intro) and it is *actively wrong* for dual-account committees today, so correcting it is the urgent, mechanical, decision-free fix. The un-gate is deferred behind it.
> - **Representation — (a) conserve using the parents.** Soft money stays commingled inside the Operating-expenditures and FEA parents (NOT split into fed/non-fed nodes), with one tooltip line of disclosure. The two-account fed/non-fed split is the separate hard/soft visualization Sloane has scoped — explicitly NOT this un-gate.
> - **Scope — the un-gate is a separate Step 5 item**, sequenced after the donut fix ships.
>
> **Verified universal — penny-exact across all 5** (C00019331 WI · C00105668 CA · C00099267 TX · C00099259 FL Rep · C00193433 EMILY's List): both parent identities (`operating_expenditures` = `other_fed_operating_expenditures + shared_fed_operating_expenditures + shared_nonfed_operating_expenditures`; `fed_election_activity` = `non_allocated_fed_election_activity + shared_fed_activity + shared_fed_activity_nonfed`), the raised-side non-fed gap (`receipts − fed_receipts` = `transfers_from_nonfed_account + transfers_from_nonfed_levin` **exactly** — nothing else hides in it), the cash identity, and field presence on the **single** `/totals/` record (every allocation child is already there → **no extra API calls**).
>
> **The one break — named leaves DON'T always close (the load-bearing caveat):** Texas (C00099267) spent leaves miss **$17,063.22 (0.11%)** that is in **no exposed field** (subset-searched every numeric field — not refunds, not loans). So the un-gated Sankey **must conserve via a remainder** (`disbTotal − Σ modeled` on uses, `receiptTotal − Σ modeled` on sources), NOT a complete named-leaf set — otherwise it under-sums on TX-like committees. (EMILY's List is type Q with a $26.3M non-fed account → Gate 1 catches certain **PACs**, not only parties; the trigger is "maintains a non-fed account," not committee type. My a-priori assumption that hybrid-PAC accounts stay all-federal was wrong — verified.)
>
> **Donut fix — ✓ EXECUTED 2026-06-09 (committee.html; verified live on WI/TX/DCCC + Playwright route-override tests):**
> - **Spent donut** — drop `shared_nonfed_operating_expenditures` from `CATEGORY_KEYS`: it is *inside* the `operating_expenditures` parent, so listing both double-counts (verified $15.3M double-count on WI; worse, the double-count displaces FEA out of the `max(0, total − knownSum)` remainder).
> - **Spent donut** — add a **Federal Election Activity** wedge (`fed_election_activity` parent). On a state party it is the single largest category (WI: $27.4M = 44.5% of spend) and is currently invisible (buried in "Other").
> - **Raised donut** — add a **non-fed transfers** wedge (`transfers_from_nonfed_account + transfers_from_nonfed_levin`) and fix the **% denominator** to true `receipts`. Today the wedges sum to ≈`fed_receipts` while the center shows `totalRaised`, silently rebasing every percentage (EMILY's "56.2%" is of a base ~42% below the headline; the $26.3M non-fed is omitted entirely).
>
> **Un-gate work — Step 5 (when scheduled):** add to the Sankey an **FEA uses node** (`fed_election_activity` parent, push-by-presence), a **non-fed transfers source** (fold into "Transfers in"), and switch **both** catch-alls to **remainders** so residuals like TX's $17K are absorbed (conservation by construction). **Keep the `operating_expenditures` parent** — the adapter already uses it (line ~131 of `sankey.js`), so it has none of the donut's double-count. Re-run the §verify-set incl. **all 5 dual-account committees, especially TX** (the remainder must absorb the residual). Tooltips (minimal, representation (a)): "Transfers in" — notes it includes the committee's own non-federal account; "Federal Election Activity" — plain-language voter-registration / GOTV in the pre-election window, funded partly with non-federal money; "Operating expenditures" — optionally notes the shared fed/non-fed allocation. **No full hard/soft explainer** (that's representation (b), the separate viz).
>
> **Don't-break-existing — verified safe:** fed-only national committees (DCCC C00000935 / NRCC / DNC / NRSC) all have **FEA = 0** and conserve to the penny today → the FEA node is a no-op (push-by-presence) and the remainder equals named `other_disbursements` for them. FEA is **disjoint** from operating (the spent MECE closes with both as separate leaves), so adding it can never double-count — worst case for a hypothetical fed-only committee that *does* carry FEA, it's a strict improvement (today it'd be silently dropped). Candidate Form 3 / 3P: all these fields are 3X-only → absent → `|| 0` → no-op.
>
> **Gate 1 prevalence (sampled, rough):** ~17% of active type-X and ~41% of active type-Y committees trip Gate 1 → roughly **~150–200 party committees per cycle**, plus a smaller set of non-fed-account PACs (EMILY's-class). Big-dollar names (state parties, EMILY's List) are few by count but financially significant. (2024 registered: type X 374, type Y 240; type O ~2,483 is mostly pure-federal super PACs — not a major Gate-1 contributor.)

**Gate 2 — presidential committees (Form 3P).** Out of v1 (the earlier A5 call). Form 3P carries extra leaves the v1 model doesn't render. Fast-follow.

> **Gate 2 — verified status + ungate path (updated 2026-06-09).** The blocker was narrowed to a single proven cause; the receipt-side concern is resolved.
> - **Receipt side — RESOLVED.** The original worry (`federal_funds`, plus the big transfer) is handled: `federal_funds` is pushed by presence, and the `transfers_from_affiliated_committee` coalesce (added 2026-06-09) closed the ~$534M JFC-transfer residual. Modern privately-funded presidential committees (Biden/Harris/Trump 2016–2024) now conserve on **both** sides to $0 under the current adapter — they would render fine if ungated.
> - **Disbursement side — the remaining blocker, PROVEN.** Publicly-financed presidential campaigns (any candidate that took matching funds — common pre-2012) report spending in the Form-3P exempt categories `fundraising_disbursements` and `exempt_legal_accounting_disbursement`, which the v1 disbursement leaf set does **not** model. Verified live 2026-06-09 on a public-financing general-election campaign (`federal_funds` $84.1M): disbursement residual **+$7,974,765 = `fundraising_disbursements` $6,816,641 + `exempt_legal_accounting_disbursement` $1,158,124** (exact). So an ungated Sankey would under-sum the spend side by ~$8M for any publicly-financed campaign. Modern campaigns have these fields at $0 — which is why a Biden/Harris-only spot-check would have falsely cleared ungating; the sweep across the presidential field is what caught it. (Lesson: verify across the whole class before lifting a gate.)
> - **Ungate path (small, defined — Step 5 "presidential modeling," after Step 4):** (1) add two disbursement leaf nodes — `fundraising_disbursements` + `exempt_legal_accounting_disbursement` (one node each, or folded — a labeling call); (2) re-run the presidential conservation sweep (modern + publicly-financed) and confirm $0 residual on both sides; (3) verify candidate.html's 4-year presidential path end-to-end (CLAUDE.md flags it untested — the Sankey reads the `election_full` record so likely fine, but unverified); (4) add a presidential entity to the §verify-set, then remove the `isPresidential` gate. The donut fallback (which also now carries the `transfers_from_affiliated_committee` coalesce) covers presidential safely in the interim — no user-facing harm in waiting.

**The honest gate (constraint):** a gated entity resolves to a neutral "not yet modeled" state, not an under-summing chart and not a donut fallback. Detection point + placement + copy are proposed as options in the Sankey build plan (not yet built).

## 5. Contra-flows: offsets + refunds (Sloane's call)

Two categories recirculate — money crosses the in/out boundary:
- `offsets_to_operating_expenditures` is a **receipt** that's really a refund of prior **spending**.
- `contribution_refunds` is a **disbursement** that returns money received as a **contribution**.

**Key clarification (added 2026-06-05):** these two categories are ALREADY full members of the MECE partition (§1) — offsets is a receipt leaf, refunds is a disbursement leaf. **The Sankey totals exactly with no special treatment at all.** "Contra-flow" is not what makes it balance, and not a more *accurate* number — it's a more *expressive* way to draw categories that are represented regardless. There are three distinct treatments, and they are NOT all math-neutral:

| Treatment | What it does | Numbers | Matches Raised/Spent stat cards? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Plain (baseline)** | Offsets = a normal left source; refunds = a normal right sink. Both at gross. | Exact `receipts` / `disbursements` | ✓ Yes |
| **2. Thin recirculating flow** (visual annotation only) | Same as #1 but drawn distinctly (thin/curved/looped/colored) to *signal* "recirculating, not fresh/terminal money" | **Byte-identical to #1** | ✓ Yes |
| **3. Netting** | Net offsets into operating_expenditures and refunds into contributions → shows `net_operating_expenditures` / `net_contributions` | **Totals SHRINK to net figures** (Sankey still balances node-to-node, but headline totals drop) | ✗ **No — would mismatch the stat cards** |

Worked example (Marie 2024): gross receipts $11,856,001.72 / disbursements $11,895,854.48; fully netted → $11,660,957.44 / $11,700,810.20. The receipts−disbursements gap is preserved either way (so cash-on-hand reconciliation survives), but the netted headline no longer matches `#stat-raised`/`#stat-spent`.

**Scale check:** these are small slivers for most committees (Marie: offsets 0.37% of receipts, refunds 1.3% of disbursements), so plain (#1) likely renders as two barely-visible threads.

**Decision (Sloane, 2026-06-04, refined 2026-06-05):** start with **plain, gross (#1)** so the Sankey total matches the stat cards above it. Only reach for the **recirculating visual (#2)** if offsets-reading-as-fundraising actually bothers us against the rendered result — it's a pure legibility call, zero math cost. **Avoid netting (#3)** unless we accept the stat-card mismatch (probably not worth it). The earlier "net them out if they don't read well" framing was imprecise — netting is a real tradeoff with a consistency cost, not a free visual toggle.

## 6. Spending purpose — deferred, with an accuracy-flip worth noting

The "purpose" breakdown (media / payroll / fundraising / etc. — today's Spending-by-Purpose bars) is **not in the `/totals/` endpoint.** `operating_expenditures` is one flat bucket. Purpose detail lives only in **Schedule B transaction data** (`disbursement_description` free text → `PURPOSE_MAP` keyword bucketing), which:
- does **not** sum back to `operating_expenditures` (capped 500-txn walk, memo rows, messy descriptions);
- for **Senate / presidential**, is further degraded because the current purpose bars only include **the latest subcycle's** transactions, not the full cycle.

**The flip:** the totals-based Sankey is *more accurate than what it replaces* for multi-subcycle offices, because `/totals/?election_full=true` returns the full-cycle pre-aggregated figures. The purpose layer is the thing that *reintroduces* the subcycle/cap/memo inaccuracy. So "ship totals Sankey first, research purpose later" isn't just easier — it's strictly more correct in the interim.

**Future purpose-layer research questions (not now):**
- Can purpose be a *separate view* (toggle) rather than replacing the totals categories, so the conserving totals Sankey stays the honest default?
- Can the full-cycle Schedule B walk be made to conserve (or get a visible reconciling "Unclassified" flow)?
- Does the subcycle limitation get fixed by iterating all subcycles for Schedule B (the way `/totals/?election_full=true` already does for aggregates)?

## 7. Accessibility — accepted reduced scope (Sloane's call)

A11y is normally a stated project priority, but **Sankey accessibility is genuinely hard** (flow geometry doesn't map cleanly to a screen-reader narrative, and most charting libs render to canvas with no semantic tree). **Decision (Sloane, 2026-06-04): this chart may ship without full accessibility features, and that's acceptable for this purpose** — provided there's a reasonable workaround so the data isn't *only* available in the chart.

**Proposed workaround (to validate at build):** pair the Sankey with a visually-hidden (`.sr-only`) or expandable data table that states the same flows in text — "Individual itemized contributions: $7.5M (63% of receipts)" etc. The numbers already exist (they're the node/flow values), so the table is cheap, fully accessible, and doubles as a no-JS / print fallback. This keeps the *information* accessible even if the *visualization* isn't. Consider an `aria-label` summary on the chart container pointing to the table.

---

## 8. Library evaluation

### Hard constraints (rule things in/out)
- **No build step.** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, CDN-only `<script>` — no npm/bundler. (Project convention; see CLAUDE.md.)
- **Must be free** for commercial use (possible go-live / paywall). **→ Highcharts removed** (paid commercial license; Sloane's call 2026-06-04).
- **Tooltips must match** the existing `.viz-tt` HTML-tooltip system (`externalChartTooltip` in `utils.js`). **Approach (Sloane's call): style over the library's tooltip, invest in full alignment as a follow-up.** So a lib whose tooltip is CSS-stylable / overridable is preferred over one that bakes its tooltip into a canvas.
- **Themeable** to the parchment palette + `--cat-*` tokens.
- **Low maintenance burden.** Steer away from any option that could get messy/hard to maintain (rules against hand-building, see below).
- A second charting lib alongside Chart.js 4.4.0 is on the table (Chart.js has no Sankey).

### Candidates

| Library | License | Sankey | CDN / no-build | Tooltip stylable | Maintain risk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Apache ECharts** | Apache-2.0 (free, incl. commercial) | Native `series.type:'sankey'` | Yes, single CDN file | Yes — `tooltip.formatter` + CSS, or fully custom HTML | Low | Strongest "free + batteries-included" fit. SVG **or** canvas renderer (SVG helps the a11y/print story). Themeable via option object reading our tokens. |
| **D3 + d3-sankey** | ISC/BSD (free) | Plugin computes layout; you render SVG | Yes (d3 CDN) | N/A — you build everything, so total control | **High** ← against Sloane's maintain-simple steer | Max control over theming/a11y/responsive-collapse and tooltip alignment, but you own all rendering, resize, interaction code. Most code to maintain. **Deprioritized** unless a lib proves too rigid. |
| **Plotly.js** | MIT (free) | Native sankey trace | Yes, but large bundle (~3MB+) | Partial — `hovertemplate`; harder to fully match `.viz-tt` | Medium | Works, but heavy for a no-build site already loading Chart.js. Tooltip alignment is the weak spot. |
| **Google Charts** | Free to use, **but** see drawbacks | Native sankey | Loader only — **see below** | Limited / awkward to fully restyle | Medium-High | Significant non-obvious drawbacks → §8.1. |
| ~~Highcharts~~ | ~~Paid commercial license~~ | — | — | — | — | **Removed** — not free for commercial use. |

### 8.1 Google Charts — the remote-loader drawbacks (researched 2026-06-04)

Beyond "it's a Google dependency," there are concrete reasons it fits this project poorly:

- **Self-hosting is prohibited by Google's ToS.** You may NOT download/host `loader.js` or the visualization code on your own servers. Every visitor's browser **must** fetch `https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js` at runtime. ([Google Charts FAQ](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/faq))
- **Hard external runtime dependency.** If gstatic is blocked (corporate firewall, CSP, ad-blocker, region), down, or the user is offline, the chart simply doesn't render — for a portfolio piece that's a reliability/quality risk outside your control. CSP issues are a recurring real-world complaint.
- **Privacy posture mismatch.** The chart *data* stays client-side (Google Charts doesn't exfiltrate your dataset), but every page view still pings Google's servers for the loader, revealing usage to Google. The brief explicitly flags harassment/privacy concerns for a politics tool — a no-third-party-pings posture is more defensible.
- **No version pinning on your terms.** You load from Google's CDN under their cadence, not a self-hosted pinned file.
- **Deprecation terms.** Google Charts is currently "actively maintained" and not deprecated, **but** the terms let Google cease a version on notice (and immediately in some cases). A dependency you can't self-host AND can't guarantee longevity of is a poor base for a long-lived portfolio piece. ([Google deprecation policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/deprecation))
- **Tooltip restyling is awkward** — works against the "match `.viz-tt`" goal.

### 8.2 Leaning (not a decision — for the Chat conversation)

**Apache ECharts** looks like the best fit on paper: free + commercial-OK, native sankey, single self-hostable CDN file (no remote-loader ToS trap), SVG renderer that helps the a11y/print fallback, and a stylable/overridable tooltip that makes the "style over the library, align fully as follow-up" plan viable. **D3+d3-sankey** is the fallback if ECharts proves too rigid to theme/collapse — but its maintenance cost cuts against Sloane's "keep it simple to maintain" steer, so it's the second choice, not the first. Validate with a quick prototype of the actual flow + parchment theming before committing.

## 9. What to bring to Claude Chat

1. **Library pick.** Confirm Apache ECharts as the default (free, native sankey, self-hostable CDN, SVG, stylable tooltip), with D3+d3-sankey as the documented fallback. Decide whether a quick two-library prototype (ECharts vs Plotly) is worth it before committing, or just commit to ECharts.
2. **Conservation visual (§4).** Show cash-on-hand-start / cash-on-hand-end / debt as nodes so the Sankey visibly balances? Or sources→committee→spend only, two ends don't sum? Affects node count and the visual story for "money that didn't move."
3. **Contra-flows (§5).** Confirm **plain gross (#1) for v1** (offsets/refunds as ordinary source/sink so the total matches the stat cards); recirculating visual (#2) only if offsets-as-fake-fundraising bothers us; netting (#3) ruled out for the stat-card mismatch. Mostly settled — just confirm.
4. **A11y workaround (§7).** Confirm the sr-only / expandable data-table pairing as the accepted accessible fallback, and whether it should be visible-by-default (a "View as table" toggle) or hidden.
5. **Spending-purpose phasing (§6).** Confirm purpose is out of v1; decide whether the eventual purpose layer is a *separate toggle view* (keeping the conserving totals Sankey as the honest default) vs. replacing the totals spend categories.
6. **Scope of replacement.** Does the Sankey replace BOTH donuts (raised + spent) in one chart, on BOTH `candidate.html` and `committee.html`? And does it replace the Spending-by-Purpose bars only once the purpose layer lands, or do the bars stay as a separate section indefinitely?
7. **Tooltip follow-up sequencing.** Agree that v1 ships with a "good enough" styled-over library tooltip and full `.viz-tt` alignment is an explicit, separately-ticketed follow-up — so it doesn't block the first ship.

Conservation method: sum the leaf fields per §2 (excluding all §1 trap fields), compare to `receipts` / `disbursements`. All four entities reconcile to the penny ($0.00 residual on both sides) with the corrected leaf set, verified 2026-06-08 — see the §1 supersession note (the earlier "party/conduit within rounding" figures were a hand-computation leaf-set error, now corrected).

### Test fixtures — candidates exercising the self-funding / loans split (verified live 2026-06-08)

For validating the candidate.html donut grouping (§3) and the future Sankey — candidates with **all three** loan/self fields non-zero (so both the "Candidate self-funding" and "Loans" wedges render, and the self-loan-vs-bank-loan split is exercised). Both have 2024 detail-view pages. Sourced from the FEC bulk candidate-summary file (`weball24`, cols 12/13/14 = CAND_CONTRIB / CAND_LOANS / OTHER_LOANS), cross-checked against `/candidate/{id}/totals/?election_full=true`:

| Candidate | URL | gift (`candidate_contribution`) | self-loan (`loans_made_by_candidate`) | bank loan (`all_other_loans`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Michael Sapraicone** (S-NY 2024) | `/candidate/S4NY00404#2024` | $83,451 | $600,000 | $50,050 | Most *balanced* all-three; best for showing all three fields as distinct. Senate = 6-yr multi-subcycle. (His `H4NY03184` House id has no election_full record — use the `S4…` id.) |
| **Paul Junge** (H-MI08 2024) | `/candidate/H0MI08141#2024` | $355 | $4,100,000 | $700,000 | Largest ($5.98M receipts), cleanest House 2-yr cycle; both wedges prominent but gift is a token $355. |

### Sankey verify-set (conservation, verified live 2026-06-08)

The entity-aware adapter (per §2 leaf set + §4a gates) must be checked against each of these to the penny before shipping. Adapter run on 2026-06-08: receipt + disbursement node-sums reconcile to **$0.00** residual on all of rows 1–6; the gated row (7) is the canonical case the earlier "all six conserve" pass *missed* because the set had no dual-account committee.

| # | Entity | ID / cycle | Form | Role in the set |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MGP | H2WA03217 / 2024 | 3 | Normal candidate; thin right side |
| 2 | Nancy Pelosi | H8CA05035 / 2026 | 3 | Overspender (disb > receipts; reserves drawn down) |
| 3 | Michael Sapraicone | S4NY00404 / 2024 | 3 | Self-funder (exercises self-funding vs external-loans split); Senate multi-subcycle |
| 4 | DCCC | C00000935 / 2024 | 3X | Party, dense right side; **fed-only control** (fed ≡ total) |
| 5 | Senate Majority PAC | C00484642 / 2024 | 3X | Super PAC; fed-only |
| 6 | ActBlue | C00401224 / 2024 | 3X | Conduit; fed-only, but **cash identity off by ~$889** → the A1 derive-cohStart case |
| 7 | **Dem Party of Wisconsin Fed** | **C00019331 / 2024** | 3X | **Dual-account (non-federal) — GATED (§4a Gate 1).** Verifies the detector fires and the gate renders "not yet modeled" rather than under-summing by $12.1M/$15.3M. |

**Step-5 un-gate fixtures (added 2026-06-09, dual-account — all trip Gate 1; verify against ALL when lifting Gate 1 per the §4a Gate 1 decided plan):**

| # | Entity | ID / cycle | Form | Role in the un-gate set |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | California Democratic Party | C00105668 / 2024 | 3X (Y) | Dual-account; parents + raised gap + cash all close to $0.00 |
| 9 | **Texas Democratic Party** | **C00099267 / 2024** | 3X (Y) | **THE residual case** — named spent leaves miss **$17,063.22** in no exposed field → proves the un-gate must use a **remainder** node, not a named-leaf set |
| 10 | Republican Party of Florida | C00099259 / 2024 | 3X (Y) | Dual-account; FEA only 14.2% of spend (lower-FEA party, contrast with WI's 44.5%) |
| 11 | EMILY's List | C00193433 / 2024 | 3X (Q) | **Non-fed-account PAC** (not a party) — $26.3M non-fed, FEA = 0; proves Gate 1 catches PACs and the FEA node correctly stays absent when 0 |
