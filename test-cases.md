# ledger.fec — Test Cases
*Manual browser checklist. Run locally: `python3 -m http.server 8080` from project root.*

---

## How to use this file

**Automated tests (Track 1):** Run `npx playwright test` from the project root before and after changes. 170 structural tests across all pages run in ~1 minute with mocked API. See `TESTING.md` for full details.

**Smoke tests (Track 2):** Run `npm run test:smoke` before deploys. Hits the live FEC API — 5 key checks. Requires the dev server to be running.

**Manual browser checks:** Use the checklists below for things automated tests can't verify — visual design quality, chart rendering, animation smoothness, content accuracy. Run for every page touched in a session.

**Amplitude verification method:** Open DevTools → Network tab → filter for `api2.amplitude.com`. Each event appears as a POST request. Click the request to inspect the payload and confirm event name + required properties. `Page Viewed` should fire within 2 seconds of load. Interaction events should fire only on user action, not on programmatic init calls.

**Checkboxes reset each session** — uncheck everything before starting a run. The Test log is the persistent record, not the checkboxes.

## How to maintain this file

- **New feature lands:** Add test cases in the same session it ships. New page = new section. New feature on existing page = new cases in that section.
- **Known issue resolved:** Remove from Known open issues table; add corresponding test cases to the page section.
- **Scaffold → live transition:** Expand that page's section from scaffold-scope to full coverage.
- **Test log:** Append a row for every test run. Never delete old rows — they show the testing history.
